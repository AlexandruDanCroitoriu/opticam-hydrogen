# Run checks on codebase

- [x] Inspect package.json scripts
- [x] Install dependencies
- [x] Run codegen
- [x] Run typecheck
- [x] Run lint
- [x] Run build
- [x] Summarize quality gates

Notes:
- Dependencies installed with `npm ci`.
- Initial audit found 5 vulnerabilities (4 low, 1 moderate).
- Applied `npm audit fix` (non-breaking). Remaining: 4 low (transitive via `@shopify/mini-oxygen` → `miniflare` → `youch` → `cookie`). Fix would require a breaking downgrade to `@shopify/mini-oxygen@3.2.1`; deferred pending upstream 4.x patch.
- Build succeeded; a few empty chunks were generated by the router build (informational).
